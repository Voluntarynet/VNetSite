        <div class="SectionTitle2">
            What's special about VoluntaryNet? 
        </div>
        <div class="SectionContent">
            VoluntaryNet is:<br>
            Decentralized, not federated<!--(like Mastodon, Diaspera, etc)-->.<br>
            Browser based, not a native app<!--(like Beaker Browser, Freenet, etc)-->.<br>
            A platform, not just a particular app.</br>
            Apps share: identity, discovery, relay, and secure messaging.<br>
            Discovery is decentralized (anyone can add a rendezvous server to the network).
        </div>


        <div class="SectionTitle2">
            Why decentralized instead of federated?
        </div>
        <div class="SectionContent">
            Federated systems (such as email, Diaspora, Mastodon) have servers with owners who effectively own your identity and can censor your messages. 
            In decentralized systems, you own your identies and messages are effectively uncensorable. 
        </div>


        <!--

            What exactly makes this decentralized?
        </div>
        <div class="SectionContent">
            p2p webrtc messaging
            only client state (all keys and data client side), no server state, can run locally
            eventually sandboxed 3rd party apps
        </div>
         -->


        <div class="SectionTitle2">
            Is this like Mastodon?
        </div>
        <div class="SectionContent">
            A bit, but it's different in important ways. Mastodon is a federated Twitter-like native app. Voluntary is an in-browser decentralized platform on which a Twitter-like app is provided as an example.
        </div>



        <div class="SectionTitle2">
            Is this like Beaker Browser/IPFS?
        </div>
        <div class="SectionContent">
            They are different classes of things but complementary. 
            Beaker Browser is a type of web browser that gets files from a decentralized file store (IPFS). 
            Voluntary.net is a single page web app that could be run inside most web browsers, 
            including Beaker Browser, or even directly from a file on your desktop.
        </div>



        <div class="SectionTitle2">
            Is this like Zeronet?
        </div>
        <div class="SectionContent">
            Zeronet, like Beaker Browser, is focused on websites but (like Voluntary) adds support for identity management. Zeronet and Beaker require special native apps. Voluntary supports identity management in conjunction with a common messaging system, and works within most browsers.  
        </div>
        

        <div class="SectionTitle2">
            Is this like Steemit?
        </div>
        <div class="SectionContent">
            No. Steemit is centralized ad-based, highly censored social media platform.
            Voluntary is decentralized, add free, and has no trusted parties which can censored content.
        </div>

            Can the messaging model work without servers?
        </div>
        <div class="SectionContent">
            This is a good question. The problem with the gossip-among-friends protocol is the need for at least one other friend to be online when you are in order for message relaying to work. If you have many friends, this isn't an issue, but for a small number of friends the chance of another friend being online can be small. There are several possible solutions: use open relay clients, have a setting for clients to optionally relay (up to some bandwidth limit) for more than just their own friends, pay other clients to relay for you.

        <div class="SectionTitle2">
            Does this involve a blockchain?
        </div>
        <div class="SectionContent">
            No. Blockchains are useful for distributed ledgers but create scaling, latency, bandwidth,
            and other issues for large systems (such as messaging systems) which don't require everyone to agree on a common global state.  
        </div>
        
        <div class="SectionTitle2" style="max-width: 100%;">
            Don't ISPs need to be decentralized for true decentralization?
        </div>
        <div class="SectionContent">
            As you can build centralized apps like Facebook on top of a mesh network, 
            a mesh network in itself doesn't make for a top-to-bottom decentralized communications system.
            So we <i>also</i> need a decentralized identity and messaging layer, and true decentralized apps on top, 
            in order to have a top-to-bottom decentralized communications/applications system. 
            VoluntaryNet is one solution for those top two layers.
        </div>


        <div class="SectionTitle2">
            Is there a business model?
        </div>
        <div class="SectionContent">
            No. This is just an open source project and the goal is for everyone to run it localy in their web browser and eventually not use the voluntary.app site at all. All keys and data are stored client side. There's no ads, tokens, paywalls, etc. There may be people that want to offer always-on message relay servers for a price, but as long as you have enough friends in your network, you shouldn't need one.  
        </div>

            What's the goal of the project?
        </div>
        <div class="SectionContent">
            Our goal is to scale to global messaging systems levels (email, SMS, etc).

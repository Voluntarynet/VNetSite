            Frequently Asked Questions
        </div>


        <div class="SectionTitle2">
            Is this like Mastodon?
        </div>
        <div class="SectionContent">
            A bit, but it's different in important ways. Mastodon is a federated Twitter-like native app where your identity is tied to a given server that has the power to censor users and posts. Voluntary is browser-based decentralized platform on which apps can be built and share it's common identity and messaging system and on which a Twitter-like app is provided as an example.
        </div>



        <div class="SectionTitle2">
            Is this like Beaker Browser/IPFS?
        </div>
        <div class="SectionContent">
            They are different classes of things but complementary. 
            Beaker Browser is a type of web browser that gets files from a decentralized file store (IPFS). 
            Voluntary.net is a single page web app that could be run inside most web browsers, 
            including Beaker Browser, or directly from a file on your desktop.
        </div>



        <div class="SectionTitle2">
            Is this like Zeronet?
        </div>
        <div class="SectionContent">
            Zeronet, like Beaker Browser, is focused on websites but (like Voluntary) adds support for identity management but both Zeronet and Beaker require special browsers. Voluntary supports identity management in conjunction with a common messaging system, and works across browsers.  
        </div>
        

        <div class="SectionTitle2">
            Is this like Steemit?
        </div>
        <div class="SectionContent">
            No. Steemit is centralized ad-based and highly censored social media platform.
            Voluntary is decentralized and has no ads.
        </div>

        <div class="SectionTitle2">
            Can the messaging model work without servers?
        </div>
        <div class="SectionContent">
            This is a good question. The problem with the gossip-among-friends protocol is...
        </div>
    -->

    
        <div class="SectionTitle2">
            Does this involve a blockchain?
        </div>
        <div class="SectionContent">
            No. Blockchains are useful for distributed ledgers but not for messaging systems which don't require everyone to agree on a common global state.
        </div>
        


        <div class="SectionTitle2">
            Is there a business model?
        </div>
        <div class="SectionContent">
            No. This is just an open source project and the goal is for everyone to run it localy in their web browser and not use the voluntary.app site at all. All keys and data are stored client side. There's no ads, tokens, paywalls, etc. There may be people that want to offer always-on message relay servers for a price, but as long as you have enough friends in the network, you shouldn't need one.
